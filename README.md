# CLI Data Structure Programs

Welcome to the **CLI Data Structure Programs** repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of **Data Structure implementations** written in **C**. Each program can be executed from the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, making it easy to practice and understand fundamental data structures in a real-world environment.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Data Structures Covered**:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)
  - Stacks
  - Queues (Linear and Circular)
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
  - Graphs (DFS, BFS)
  - Hash Tables
  - Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
  - Sorting and Searching Algorithms

- **CLI-Based Programs**: Execute all the programs directly from the command line, making it easy to test and understand the logic without relying on any IDE.

- **Step-by-step Explanations**: Each program comes with comments to help you understand the logic and how each data structure works.

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/CLI-Data-Structure-Programs.git
    cd CLI-Data-Structure-Programs
    ```

2. **Compile the program** (for C/C++):
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o outputfile
    ```
